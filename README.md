# NeetCode Python Practice

This repository contains my solutions to coding problems from NeetCode’s Python course.  
I’m organizing problems by difficulty to track my learning progress:

- Easy  
- Medium  
- Hard  

Each solution is written in Python, with clear explanations and comments.  
This repo helps me improve problem-solving skills and prepare for placements.

Feel free to browse and suggest improvements!
